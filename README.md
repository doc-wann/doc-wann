My journey in coding began in 2021, and since then, I've dedicated myself to mastering various programming languages and technologies, with a strong focus on <b>backend engineering</b>, <b>AI-driven commercial solutions</b>, and <b>game development</b>. I believe in continuous learning and constantly strive to refine my skills and push the boundaries of what's possible. </p>

<p> I am no longer a student at 42SP but have transitioned into professional roles where I apply the knowledge and experience gained during my studies. I'm deeply involved in multiple projects that reflect my interests in technology and innovation. Feel free to explore my work and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or discuss anything tech-related. </p>

<h4> Interests </h4>

<p> My pronouns are he/him, and I'm particularly passionate about <b>storytelling</b> and <b>game development</b>. My journey into programming was fueled by my love for creating immersive experiences, starting with a D&D-based text RPG, which, although lost to time, still inspires my current projects.
