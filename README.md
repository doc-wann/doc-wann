### Hi! Hope you're having a nice day ;) My name is  Henrique, and I'm a software engineer at 42 São Paulo. 👋😁

First of all, let me introduce myself - I've been coding since 2021, and am very eager to learn and improve my skills. I'm currently learning mostly C, since it is a very influential coding language - to be real, most of my learning revolves around actual code engineering, data-structures and clever ways to improve and make systems more effective. I aim to be studing at 42 for at least a few months before actually starting a professional career. 💼

If you're also a 42 student, or any kind of curious programmer that ends bumping into my codes, feel free to call me and give a word of advice! 🧑‍🚀

You can reach me through my e-mail, kikevdani@gmail.com or add me in discord if you up for a chat DocWann#6866... ⚡️

I use he/him pronouns, and really like story-telling and game-developing. In fact, my very first program is a D&D based text rpg, which I saddly lost the code for recently! I look forward to help, and if I'm contributing to this wonderful community in any way, you can be sure that I'll me flattered to be of use. 🔭
