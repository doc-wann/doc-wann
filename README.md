<h2 align="center"> Hi! Hope you're having a nice day ;) </h2>
  
<h4> My name is  Henrique, and I'm a software engineer at 42 São Paulo. 👋😁 </h4>
  
<p title="I'm a introduction!"> First of all, let me introduce myself - I've been coding since 2021, and am very eager to learn and improve my skills. I'm currently learning mostly C, since it is a very influential coding language - to be real, most of my learning revolves around actual code engineering, data-structures and clever ways to improve and make systems more effective. I aim to be studing at 42 for at least a few months before actually starting a professional career. 💼 </p>
  
<p> If you're also a 42 student, or any kind of curious programmer that ends bumping into my codes, feel free to call me and give a word of advice! 🧑‍🚀</p>
  
  <p> You can reach me through my e-mail, <b> kikevdani@gmail.com </b> or add me in discord if you up for a chat <b>DocWann#6866</b>... ⚡️</p>
  
<p> I use he/him pronouns, and really like story-telling and game-developing. In fact, my very first program was a D&D based text rpg, which I saddly lost the code for recently! I look forward to help, and if I'm contributing to this wonderful community in any way, you can be sure that I'll me flattered to be of use. 🔭</p>
